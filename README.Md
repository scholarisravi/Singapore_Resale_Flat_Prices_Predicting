# Singapore Resale Flat Prices Predicting

## Overview

This project aims to predict resale flat prices in Singapore using data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and model deployment techniques. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we seek to provide accurate predictions for resale flat prices, aiding both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions in the Singapore real estate market.

## Skills Takeaway

Through this project, you will gain proficiency in the following areas:

- **Data Wrangling:** Learn how to clean, preprocess, and format raw data for analysis and modeling.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Discover insights, patterns, and relationships within the data through visualization and statistical analysis.
  
- **Model Building:** Develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms to forecast resale flat prices based on relevant features.
  
- **Model Deployment:** Deploy the trained models into production environments for real-time predictions, enhancing accessibility and usability.
